<h2>The Fallacy<a class="headerlink" href="#the-fallacy" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>In class, you stated that a .org top-level domain afforded a level of credibility above that of the .com. When I spoke to the contrary, I was not only booed, but you made the unsubstantiated claim that .org domains required certification of one’s status as a non-profit organization. A student then made a web search to support the discussion (while not utilizing the information-vetting strategies you had just taught) and incorrectly stated that .org domains did require verification. This is clearly wrong, as I have acquired a .org domain without any verification. All I needed was a PayPal account.</p>

<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>I checked for my domain of choice on <a class="reference external" href="https://porkbun.com/">Porkbun</a>, a popular, affordable domain registrar. <img alt="An image of the .org's availability on a domain registrar." src="_images/image_1.png" /></p></li>
<li><p>I purchased the domain. <img alt="An image of me purchasing the domain." src="_images/image_2.png" /></p></li>
<li><p>To secure the site and speed up loading, I set the nameservers to CloudFlare nameservers to make use of CloudFlare’s DDoS protection and content distribution system, respectively. <img alt="An image of me changing the nameservers in Porkbun's control panel." src="_images/image_3.png" />
<img alt="An image of the CloudFlare dashboard for this domain." src="_images/image_4.png" /></p></li>
<li><p>I wrote this page in <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown">Markdown</a> and used <a class="reference external" href="https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/index.html">Sphinx</a> to convert it to <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML">HTML</a>. <img alt="An image of me writing this website." src="_images/image_5.png" /></p></li>
<li><p>I hosted this on my server and set CloudFlare to forward the content of my webserver to this domain. (No image this time because it’s mostly just editing configuration files).</p></li>
<li><p>That was it. Those were all the steps.</p></li>

<p>One might say that all this requires an awful amount of tech-savviness and expertise, but the reality is that anyone with Google, common sense, and $7.49 in digitally supported money can do it.</p>

<h2>The Exigence<a class="headerlink" href="#the-exigence" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p><s>Pure, unbridled spite and a passion for facts.</s><br><br>
  [What follows is an August 10th, 2023 Revision]<br>It's my autism, actually. I just found it easier for
  the unnamed (and wrong) teacher to continue living in her fantasy world where facts are a matter of opinion
  and I was just a weird, mean student. The fact of the matter is that it is trivially easy to fact check,
  as we are in the era of the internet.
